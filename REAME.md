# JScriptrator - minimalistic arcade game in Javascript.

## "A first attempt of a long-time C++ programmer to learn Javascript"

I decided to start learning Javascript by doing, so I set myself the
goal to recode my arcade C++ game [FLTrator]( https://github.com/wcout/FLTrator),
which uses [FLTK](www.fltk.org) to Javascript.

The HTML5 canvas API is very similar to the basic drawing routines
of FLTK, which made the conversion generally straightforward.

I am using and mixing all ECMA script standards up to ES6 here in one
program, because it lets me stay close to C++. My resources have only been
the [Mozilla Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTML/Canvas)
and my favourite search engine..

But please don't use this program to learn Javascript - it will probably
considered as 'using strange practices' by experienced Javascript programmers...

Tested with Firefox 59 and Chromium browser 65 (must be started with
`--allow-file-access-from-files` when running locally).

*NOTE*: The 'Original' has been transcoded faithfully, but not identical and
        not completely. The goal was only to prove that it can be done. As this
        goal has been reached, I don't feel motivated enough to port all aspects.
